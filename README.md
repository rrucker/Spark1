# Spark1
2012 --- Beginning notes on Scala &amp; Spark interactions
I shlw some basic Scala code HOFs and such as well as a couple of methods useful for 
later calculations involving cosine similarity ( NLP ). 
I have constructed a few interactive Scala Worksheets as well to show each Scala and Spark type
that is used. There is a Spark template to get started as well ( although the worksheets have 
these immports .

The build,sbt file has the Spark 3.0.1 modules , and the Couchbase Scala SDK 1.1.1,
as well as Breeze and Breeze-viz.
